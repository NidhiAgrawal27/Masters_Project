### About
This repository contains the code for analysis of Bitcoin cryptocurrency datasets using Girvanâ€“Newman algorithm.

### Setup and execution on Terminal
Install and activate conda environment 'master_proj_env' from conda_env.yml
(The name of the environment can be changed in the conda_env.yml file.)

Next, execute the following steps:
1. Go to directory correspondence_network/src using command:
    $ cd girvan_newmann_heuristic/src
2. Run the following command to run the bash script to run the main file in src folder.
    $ ./run.sh

Results are by default saved in the `logs` directory generated on path given in src/utilities/pathnames.py file.

### Reproducibility
All experiments are run with a fixed global seed (determined by argument `--seed`) to ensure reproducibility. Unfortunately, actual results may differ slightly due to some unknown stochastic behaviour. Rerunning the experiments may therefore produce slightly different results.
